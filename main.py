  # nextPageToken. "nextPageToken" is simply a string field for paging through
  # result sets. "items" is what is called a "MessageField", meaning its value
  # is a ProtoRPC message itself; it is also a repeated field, meaning we have
  # an array of values rather than a single value. The nested ProtoRPC message
  # in the definition of "items" uses the same schema in MyModel.method, so each
  # value in the "items" array will have the fields attr1, attr2 and created.
  # As with MyModel.method, overrides can be specified for both the schema of
  # the request that defines the query and the schema of the messages contained
  # in the "items" list. We'll see how to use these in further examples.
